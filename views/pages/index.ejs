            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
            <p></p>
            <p>My Name is Seaghan Ennis and I am a student at the University of Colorado: Colorado Springs.</p>
            <p>I am an active student, who is in the process of putting myself through my last year of college. My emphasis has always been based on learning and adapting to new environments, so that I and my peers can excel and grow. I am happy to work with any team to best serve the needs of the business. I am proud to lead when chosen, and happy to follow when called upon.

                <br><br>I have extensive practice in compiled object-oriented languages like Java, C#, C++. Additionally, I have experience in interpreted languages like Ruby, Python. I also have worked with C, x86-Assembly, and RISC-V instruction sets.
                
                <br><br>This website is a project I created to help me learn JavaScript, as well as keep up on HTML and CSS.

                <br><br>I am used to working in shared repositories and version control systems like GitHub and other Git based systems. I have used containerized or virtual machine systems like Docker and Microsoft Azure.</p>
